# Van-Der-Heijden-Log-Linear-EM-Algorithm
Van Der Heijden et al Log Linear Expectation-Maximization Algorithm

# Description

This method allows imputing missing cells of a contingency table and for undergoing multiple system estimation. The algorithm assumes that any missingness is missing at random (MAR).

# Methods

- The R Package [Coarsened Variable Modeling (CVAM)](https://github.com/uscensusbureau/cvam) Version 0.9.4.3+ implements this algorithm natively.
